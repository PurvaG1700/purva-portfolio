              As a Junior Developer in ML Operations at Syngenta, I was instrumental in advancing the deployment and scalability of machine learning models to meet the demands of high-volume real-time data processing

              * ML Model Deployment: Engineered and deployed robust ML models into production environments. Developed and maintained APIs to facilitate real-time model predictions, optimizing processes to ensure rapid response times. Conducted extensive research to scale deployments effectively, handling thousands of concurrent requests.
              * Pipeline Optimization: Evaluated and implemented MLOps tools, adopting Kubeflow for creating reusable ML pipelines and KServe for efficient model serving. This strategic implementation halved the deployment time for ML models, significantly enhancing operational efficiency.
              * Cross-Functional Leadership: Spearheaded the communications squad, addressing and resolving key project blockers. Enhanced team collaboration and solution development across departments. Proficiently used Docker and Kubernetes to deploy FastAPIs and integrated Datadog for comprehensive logging of deployed APIs.
              * Project Coordination and Data Integration: Led a critical initiative to streamline data integration for ML model inputs. After identifying gaps in data availability that threatened to delay project timelines, I proactively coordinated with global teams. My efforts culminated in a strategic roadmap that not only clarified data sourcing but also expedited the project delivery by one week, avoiding potential setbacks from previously unclear requirements.

              * Technologies: FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, DynamoDB, AWS SageMaker, Kubeflow, KServe, Python, Datadog
              * Skills: API Development, Data Pipeline Construction, Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD), Database Optimization, Project Management, Strategic Problem Solving, Technical Communication
