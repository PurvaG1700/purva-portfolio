Hello! My name is Purva, and I'm currently a first-year MS Computer Science student at UCLA. I'm deeply passionate about exploring and applying cutting-edge technologies to large-scale systems. Through both my academic projects and professional experiences, I've gained practical skills in software development, distributed systems, and cloud computing. I have a particular interest in projects related to digital agriculture and have accumulated one year of experience in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) within this field. By day, I'm a techie; by night, I'm an avid bookworm.
